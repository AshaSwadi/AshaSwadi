why we will go for method overloading?
Method overloading increases the readability of the program. 

why we will go for Method overriding?
Method overriding helps in writing a generic code based on the parent class.
or
when we want to update the existing feautures we go for method overriding.

Difference between methodoverloading and method overriding?
  
   method overloading                          method overrriding
1.method overloading is used to             1.method overiding is used to

2.method overloading happens                2.method overiding happens between 
within the class.                             two classes with IS A relationship.

why we will go for interface?
Interfaces are used in  to achieve abstraction,multiple inheritance, By using the implements keyword.


why we will go for abstraction?
Datahiding,datasecurity,hiding the unneccessary details from the user.

How do we achieve abstraction?
Declaring all the essential properties in interface class and provide implementation in the subclass.
create a reference variable in interface and initialise that reference variable with the help of subclass object.

Difference between interface and abstractclass?
        Interface                                          Abstractclass

1.interface support                                   1.abstractclass does not support for
multiple inheritance.                                  multiple inheritance.

2.interface have only abstract                        2.abstractclass have abstract and non abstract 
methods.                                                 methods.

3.Interface can't provide                             3.Abstract class can provide the implementation 
implementation of abstract                              of interface.
 class.

4.The interface keyword is used                        4.The abstract keyword is used to declare  
to declare interface class.                             abstract class.


why we will go for Polymorphism?
to acheive 
singlepoint of contact:for all the classes the single point is ansim(same).
Generalisation:(upcasting)for all the class common method is same.
Loosecoupling:any changes in any one of the method will not affect the other method.

why we will go for Encapsulation?
To secure the data and provide inirect access to authorised user.


what is Immutable?
Immutable means it will not change the state of the object.

Why it is Immutable?
when multiple variables pointing to the same object if any one of the variable is reinitialised it will not
affect the another variable.

FINALLYBLOCK
FINALLY IS A BLOCK IN EXCEPTION HANDLING WHICH WILL GET EXECUTED MANDATORLY EVEN THE EXCEPTION IS ADRESSED OR
NOTADRESSED.

What is stackunwinding?
If any exception occured in any one of the method it will propagate to the main method and complete stack will get destroy
hence it is called as stackunwinding.

what is PRINTSTACKTRACE?
It is nonstatic method of the throwable class which will get inherit to each and every class and it will give complete back trace 
of exception in our system.
